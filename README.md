Hi I'm sorry for the messy site I'm still very unconfident in my javascript skills and need more practice I had trouble setting everything up and used a youtube video as a template and then got lost and had BCS help me. I need a lot of practice, I am not sure where but I messed up my javascript code and the buttons won't work. I really tried my best to give a functional site but javascript is still too new and confusing for me so I apologize for not meeting a lot of the criteria I just have no clue how to meet it at this moment in time. I do want to redo this specific homework assignment later on though and see my progress. Thank you for looking at my site and have a nice day (: (I got feedback a while ago to add more information to my readme files but I don't know what to add so I would appreciate feedback on this as well).
